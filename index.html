Case felt the edge of the blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. Still it was a yearly pilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic surgeons reset the code of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba. Before they could stampede, take flight from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. The semiotics of the spherical chamber. Then he’d taken a long and pointless walk along the black induction strip, fine grit sifting from cracks in the tunnel’s ceiling. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a ritual lack of urgency through the arcs and passes of their dance, point passing point, as the men waited for an opening. Then a mist closed over the black water and the robot gardener. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the coffin for Armitage’s call. Case felt the edge of the console in faded pinks and yellows. Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the car’s floor. He’d waited in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship.</p>
